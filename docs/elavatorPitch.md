Have you ever found yourself lost in your college and you really wish you could have something to guide you?

Well we got the solution for you! Our names are André Santos, João Afonso, Lucas Viegas, José Pedro and Sérgio Estêvão and we are the main developers of UniServices. Our applications main purpose is to provide a map of all the academic services available in the surroundings of the Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto (FEUP) that allows them to easily find on a provided map where they need to go in order to arrive at the desired service.

Unlike sigarra, UniServices provides a real time map of all the services available in FEUP facilities, as well as the current location of the user. This way the user can effortlessly locate himself and find a way to quickly get to it. What also distinguishes our app from Sigarra is that we allow the user to create reminders. With these reminders the user can choose a service and a desired time in which we wants to be remembered and the app will send a notification to the user when the time comes. The user is also able to manage all reminders created allowing him to either create a new reminder or edit/delete an existing one.

Our app is extremely easy to use and will fullfill your necessities in a simple and quick way. Try it out and tell us your opinion!
