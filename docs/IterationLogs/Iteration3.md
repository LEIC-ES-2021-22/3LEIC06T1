## Sprint Retrospective

### What went well?
- GitHub Flow went smoothly;
- Code revisions went well;
- Good refactor and testing;
- Final product shipment.

### What should we do differently?
- devido à complexidade da tarefa em relação ao tempo disponível não foi possível terminar uma versão da search bar no mapa estável e 100% operacional, logo está foi descartada do produto final. 
- Better issue planning:
    -  we should distribute issues considering front-end and back-end for better development parallelism;
    - we should estimate the issue complexity better, due to the complexity of the task, we were not able to finish the search bar for the map page and make a stable version 100% operational, so this feature was discarded from the final product.

### What still puzzles me?

- Some of the Flutter syntax.
