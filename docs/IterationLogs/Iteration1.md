# Iteration 1 Log

## Release

https://github.com/LEIC-ES-2021-22/3LEIC06T1/releases/tag/v0.5

## Sprint Retrospective

### What went well?
- Familiarization with the new technologies: Android Studio && Flutter;
- GitHub Flow went smoothly;
- Code revisions went well;
- Gherkin automated testing was included with all the issues;


### What should we do differently?
- Revision of the work load for each member, since some members didn't do the expected issues;
- Better communication;
- Trying to reach our sprint's end goals, as expected;


### What still puzzles me?

- Some of the Flutter syntax;
- Some specifics of the Gherkin automated testing;
- Some quirks of Google Maps API;
