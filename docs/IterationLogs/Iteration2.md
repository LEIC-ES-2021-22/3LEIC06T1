# Iteration 2 Log

## Release

https://github.com/LEIC-ES-2021-22/3LEIC06T1/releases/tag/v0.8

## Sprint Retrospective

### What went well?
- Every issue was correctly concluded;
- GitHub Flow went smoothly;
- Code revisions went well;

### What should we do differently?
- This week everything went according to plan as we accomplished every goal set on Sprint, so we wouldn't change anything in particular
- More Gherkin automated tests could have been done to accomplish a higher coverage
- The front-end and back-end division should have been considered when creating the issues

### What still puzzles me?

- How to implement json management into our code
- Understanding the issues related to the Google Maps API
